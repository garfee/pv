 * failed, then state->splice_failed_fd is updated to the current fd so
 * splice() won't be tried again until the next input file.
 *
 * Updates state->read_position by the number of bytes read, unless splice()
 * was used, in which case it does not since there's nothing in the buffer
 * (and it also adds the bytes to state->written since they've been written
 * to the output).
 *
 * On read error, updates state->exit_status, and if allowed by
 * state->skip_errors, tries to skip past the problem.
 *
 * If the end of the input file is reached or the error is unrecoverable,
 * sets *eof_in to 1.  If all data in the buffer has been written at this
 * point, then also sets *eof_out.
